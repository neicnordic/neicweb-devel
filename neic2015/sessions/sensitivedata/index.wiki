== Abstract ==
Public registers, biobanks, health registers and research projects are examples
of actors that collect and store vast amounts of data that has huge potential
for advancing scientific research. However, much of the data is sensitive as it
is including information on individuals and, naturally, the data needs to be
stored and processed so that integrity and privacy of individuals is secured.
Enabling the research utilising sensitive data while fulfilling legal
requirements for privacy poses a challenge for research supporting
e-Infrastructure.

This conference session aims to share experiences on developing and operating
services for sensitive data. Session includes a presentation of Nordic ELIXIR
and NeIC initiative, Tryggve, aiming to enable corss-border collaboration on
sensitive biomedical datat; a talk on secure and scalable service for sensitive
data, TSD, at Oslo University; views from BBMRI ERIC Ethical, Legal and Social
Issues activity; and experience from operating secure access services at UK Data
Archive.
