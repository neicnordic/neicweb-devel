== Abstract ==
The UK Data Service Secure Lab began providing secure remote access to
confidential and sensitive microdata four years ago.  Previously, access to
these data were only possible by visiting an ‘on-site safe room’.  Only
researchers located within the vicinity of the safe room, or those with generous
travel budgets and few departmental responsibilities, could access data and
successfully complete projects.  For anybody else, the arrival of the Secure Lab
heralded a new age of convenient access to confidential data, within a secure
setting.

In this presentation, I’ll provide an overview of the Secure Lab: our beginnings
and how we operate the service.  I’ll also provide information on how we
accredit researchers and provide training; our safe settings; and how we manage
the release of ‘safe’ results generated from confidential sources.
