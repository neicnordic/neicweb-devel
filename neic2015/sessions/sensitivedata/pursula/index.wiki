== Abstract ==
Public registers, biobanks, health register and research projects collect and
store vast amounts of data that has huge potential for advancing scientific
research. A prime example is the biomedical research aiming to improve human
health. Naturally the data needs to be stored and processed so that integrity
and privacy of individuals is secured. This talk introduces a collaboration in
ELIXIR Nordic nodes and NeIC, the Tryggve project, that aims to produce means
for sharing, combining and processing sensitive biomedical data across Nordic
countries.
