== Abstract ==
The ELSI Common Service of the European infrastructure BBMRI-ERIC officially
started 1 February. Regarding their ethical, legal and social aspects to
consider, this ELSI-CS aims to facilitate and support cross- border exchanges of
human biological resources and data attached for research uses, collaborations
and sharing of knowledge, experiences and best practices among Member States.
This will be done in full respect of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of
the EU, with the aim of promoting excellence in international biobank-based
research. The charter lays down rights both to privacy and medical treatment and
I will suggest how these should be balanced in large cohorts using personal data
and biological samples
