== Abstract ==
In the last decade the demand for services for sensitive data – subjected to the
Norwegian Personal Data Act §2, point 8 (religion, sex, health, union membership
and prosecutions) - has significantly increased. The massive usage of video,
MR-imaging and DNA-sequencing of humans has created a strong need for storage
and computing resources for sensitive data, by far exceeding the traditional
available resources, namely “single offline computer”. The University Center for
Information Technology (USIT) at the University of Oslo (UiO) took on the task
to create a solution that is both secure, user friendly and scalable. The
solution designed and implemented by USIT, namely Services for Sensitive Data
(TSD), is a multi-tenant platform for all kinds of IT-services for research.
USIT launched the TSD service in May 2014, and offers virtual servers, storage,
high performance computing (HPC) and data collection within this secure
environment. The system hosts the research projects on virtual servers residing
behind a strong firewall with a 2-factor authentication gateway. Each project is
assigned to a private sub-net, and secure storage is provided using the new 7PB
storage resource “Astrastore” at UiO. A dedicated HPC-resource is installed
inside the secure environment to meet computational needs. A PGP encrypted
version of the UiO web-questionnaire (Nettskjema) allows secure data harvesting,
e.g. from surveys and questionnaires. Furthermore the governmental ID-portal is
enabled for use with authentication to Nettskjema, thus allowing time-point
studies with strong identification of respondents from the general population.
Physical access to the TSD hardware is very restricted. In the Nordics, TSD is
presently, as far as we know, one of the most advanced services for sensitive
data in operation and maintained by a public research institution.
