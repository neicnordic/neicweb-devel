== Abstract ==
Researchers in all of the Nordic countries are making increasing use of local,
national and international e-Infrastructure resources as part of their research
routine.  Each of the countries supports their national researchers and
cooperates through the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) and through
NORDUnet. Over time, this has resulted in strong efforts to develop and share
programs that enhance the national and regional capabilities in multiple science
areas important to the Nordic region. This session brings a panel together to
discuss the future e-Infrastructure landscape in the Nordic region. Panelists
include e-infrastructure provider representatives from the Nordics and beyond,
as well as representatives from industry and Nordic organisations.
