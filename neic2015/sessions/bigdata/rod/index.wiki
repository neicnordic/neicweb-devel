== Abstract ==
During the next couple of years the European Spallation Source (ESS) will be
constructed in Lund, Sweden. This project involves 17 European partner countries
including the two host countries Sweden and Denmark. From the outset of the
planning for ESS the importance of having an integrated software, and hardware,
infrastructure for instrument control, data acquisition, data reduction and data
analysis for the instruments was recognized. The Data Management and Software
Centre (DMSC), located in Copenhagen, is responsible for delivering this
infrastructure and will be working closely with collaborators from facilities,
and universities, in the ESS partner countries to leverage experience, knowledge
and existing software in order to achieve this. In this presentation I will
describe how data acquisition will take place once ESS is in operation and our
current plans for the data processing and management infrastructure that DMSC
will deliver for the ESS instruments in the coming years.
