== Abstract ==
In pursuit of new knowledge, researchers in many fields of science seek
to acquire vast amounts of experimental data. This brings the need of
large international efforts to construct and operate extreme research
data factories: from particle accelerators to explore the microcosm, to
telescope arrays to explore the outer space. This session uncovers the
challenges of providing e-infrastructures for such facilities. Mattias
Wadenstein from HPC2N will present the Nordic centre for LHC computing,
Thomas Holm Rod of ESS will outline the plans of the data management and
software centre for the future neutron source, and Alison Kennedy of
EPCC will give an overview of requirements faced by HPC
e-infrastructures performing large scale data analytics.
