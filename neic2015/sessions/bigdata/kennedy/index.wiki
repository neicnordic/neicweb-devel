== Abstract ==
EPCC is a major HPC and Data Centre and services provider based at the
University of Edinburgh in Scotland. HPC is increasingly being used not only for
modelling and simulation, which generates large volumes of data, but also as a
tool for analysis of large datasets collected by sensors or other instruments.
This presentation looks at the differing requirements and challenges of
providing large scale compute and data services at a local, regional, national
and European level and at the role of major eInfrastructures like PRACE in
supporting a growing demand for integrated HPC and large scale data analytics.
