== Abstract ==
What are the most fruitful avenues for Nordic collaboration on e-Infrastructure
and how can successful outcomes be guaranteed? I will present my understanding
of the context in which NeIC is operating, as well as our strategy to take the
opportunities and meet the challenges for collaboration on e-Infrastructure
issues. Based on engagement and competence from an extensive virtual team, I
will share some Kung Fu lessons learned and suggest further steps.
