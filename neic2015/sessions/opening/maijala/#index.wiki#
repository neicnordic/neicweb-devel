== Abstract ==
Science is global, even though it is supported mostly by national and local
funding, via national education efforts, support services and infrastructures.
In addition to advancement of science and research, the national innovation
system is critical for the sustainable development of society. In Finland, the
Government Programme stresses the role of science, research and innovation as
the foundation of knowledge and know-how, promoting sustainable economic growth
and immaterial as well as material welfare.

To foster the research system towards better competitiveness and higher quality,
an open operational model is needed. Open science and research can significantly
increase the quality and competitiveness of national research and innovation
systems. By increasing openness in research, we will simultaneously be improving
reliability, transparency, and the impact of research. Openness also creates new
opportunities to participate in scientific advancement, and enables easier and
more effective utilization of research results and supports citizen science.

The Nordic collaboration within NeIC provides added value to researchers and
national funders. Another example of such collaboration is NORDUnet and the area
of computer networks, where Nordic collaboration has existed since 1980.
NORDUnet has enabled the Nordic research and education community to work closely
together with the international research community. Promoting open science and
research requires not only extensive involvement from the research community,
but also national and international cooperation and coordination, exploring new
ways of working, and developing research environments, researcher services and
research infrastructures. NeIC can offer a significant and valuable input by
taking national efforts in open collaboration one step further within the Nordic
collaboration.
