== Abstract ==
The cloud paradigm allows building a scalable computational and storage
infrastructure for a variety of applications. Currently most of cloud platforms
are based in a single datacenter facility. This model serves well as it allows
efficient resource management and security. However the model of building large
computational islands still requires communication and coordination between
them.

The DII-HEP private cloud, based on the OpenStack cloud suite and the Gluster
file system, is designed to provide a scalable and secure private infrastructure
for scientific applications. The infrastructure is evaluated with the Compact
Muon Solenoid (CMS) data analysis framework, a highly challenging scientific
application that requires computational, storage and network resources. For
handling security issues, we have used the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). The HIP
approach is portable (vendor agnostic), tenant oriented and thus can be deployed
in any IaaS cloud. In DII-HEP, the HIP based security layer provides bases for
building a secure multi-tenant and hybrid environment
