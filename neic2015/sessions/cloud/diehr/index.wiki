== Abstract ==
Science gateways, also known as web portals, are having a tremendous influence
on access to high performance computing. This talk will describe the launch of
science gateways in the US TeraGrid program in 2004 through the use of XSEDE
resources today. I will highlight gateway efforts more generally, for example
the International Workshop on Science Gateways and a new workshop beginning in
Australia. I will also discuss the results from a recent 29,000 person US-based
survey on gateway use, development activities and the need for a community
support model.
