== Abstract ==
In science and engineering, a tsunami of new experimental and computational data
and a suite of increasingly ubiquitous sensors pose vexing problems in data
analysis, transport, visualization and collaboration. Cloud computing and “big
data” are extending our notions of computational science and engineering,
bringing technical, political and economic challenges.  What are the hardware
and software structures and capabilities that best exploit these capabilities
and economics while providing application compatibility and community
continuity? What lessons can we learn from the world of big data and HPC and how
can they best co-exist? How do we optimize performance and reliability? How do
we integrate the emerging Internet of Things and ubiquitous sensors for
multidisciplinary fusion, while also managing security and privacy?  This talk
will compare and contrast the social, technical, political and economic
attributes of big data software and hardware with those of high-performance
computing, drawing implementation lessons and suggesting opportunities for
research and deployment.
