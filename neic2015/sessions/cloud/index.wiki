== Abstract ==
Significant intellectual property, financial investment and understanding reside 
in software and are the reasons for the long life span of popular codes. 
Institutions replace their hardware, but donâ€™t easily dispose of their software 
packages. The vast number of codes developed for research can consequently be 
considered as a research infrastructure by itself. As is also the case with 
physical infrastructures, software infrastructures evolve over time. The 
underlying platforms change through technological innovation and systems need to 
evolve continuously to stay relevant and provide value to the end-user.

This conference session contains talks on developing services and enabling easy 
access to scientific application resources. The session includes a presentation 
on the NeIC cloud computing initiative Glenna, Salman Toor will present a cloud 
Infrastructure for scientific applications and Nancy Wilkins-Diehr will give a 
talk on the launch of science gateways in the US TeraGrid through the use of 
XSEDE resources today.
