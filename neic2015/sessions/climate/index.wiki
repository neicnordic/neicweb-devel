== Abstract ==
Climate and Environmental research is almost impossible to do without
einfrastructure. Observations, analysis, modelling, storage, databases,
satellite retrievals, data ingestion, are examples of einfrastructures
researchers and engineers are totally dependent on to do climate and/or
environmental research.  But, also, when the societal contract is to be
fulfilled, giving back to society of the new insights gained, one is dependent
upon einfrastructure to accumulate, analyze, simplify, visualize, data to make
complex information readily available for the general public and decision makers.
