== Abstract ==
Observations of climate and environmental quantities are in intimate
relationship with eInfrastructure.  To do measurements themselves is nowadays
based on automatic systems, with computers, storage, networks  as the backbone.
Measurements at a single location is seldom sufficient to gain new insights, and
networks of observations are necessary. In Europe the largest, and most
important, networks are part of the ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research
Infrastructures) roadmap.  In addition, important international observational
networks as GAW (Global atmospheric watch), GCOS (Global Climate Observing
System), are also found. These networks and collaborations are dependent upon
eInfrastructure.
