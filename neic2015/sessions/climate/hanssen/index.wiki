== Abstract ==
Large European research infrastructures are presently being developed on the
Roadmap of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI). The
Nordic countries have followed the European LifeWatch ESFRI initiative closely
on its way from the preparatory phase towards the realization of LifeWatch ERIC
in 2015. In 2012-2013 the Nordic LifeWatch consortium (representatives from
several Nordic research institutions) performed a LifeWatch pilot project with
financial support from NordForsk.  The pilot project identified needs,
bottlenecks and possibilities; and developed strategies for future construction
of a common Nordic- Baltic eInfrastructure dedicated to enhance the scientific
collaboration and the science-policy interface between the individual countries.
A Nordic-Baltic collaboration can support and improve the coordination of the
national eInfrastructure initiatives, provide a common Nordic-Baltic interface
at the European level; and develop overarching cost-efficient eInfrastructures
and Virtual Research Environments (VRE) for the benefit of improved Biodiversity
and Ecosystem Research both at national, Nordic/Baltic and European level.
Through the collaboration with the national stakeholders and the Nordic
eInfrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) these ambitions will be addressed at the
NeIC 2015 Environment Workshop.
