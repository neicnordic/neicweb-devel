== Abstract ==
Our understanding of the Climate/Earth system builds on a wealth of present-day
and historical observations as well as proxy data on past climates, our
understanding of the laws of nature and experimentation with climate models. By
combining these different sources of information, we have been able to find out
about how climate has varied and changed in the course of time and possible
reasons behind, as well as how the climate is behaving today, in our own time.
For the present-day world, this knowledge is also needed to investigate how
alternative decisions about development affect the future climate and how the
observed global warming trend continues to unfold. The future is unobservable,
and many decisions which matter for climate change remain to be taken during the
next years and decades. This constitutes an uncertainty on our future climate,
but also signifies that we can choose between different alternatives, such as a
two-degree global warming or a four-degree world by the end of this century.
Advanced climate models have very high HPC-requirements, but in return offer
scientific means of projecting the outcome of near- and mid-term decisions of
greenhouse gas emissions (and thus the underlying policy, investment, energy,
technology, population and consumption trends) on mid- and long-term climate
outcomes and subsequently climate impacts. This presentation highlights the
utility of climate modelling for climate-related decisions and policies.
