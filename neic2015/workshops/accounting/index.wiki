== Abstract ==
NeIC continues its bi-annual meetings to provide a forum for those interested in
the state of accounting in the Nordic countries. These meetings serve as
knowledge transfer and discussion boards, furthermore they also serve as
reference for roadmap discussion for the ongoing NeIC SGAS maintenance project.
Further Nordic projects related to accounting are highly encouraged.
Consolidated and consistent accounting within the Nordic computing centres is
considered as one of the top-priority topics within Nordic e-Infrastructure.
Besides the continued SGAS roadmap discussion the main purpose of this workshop
is to increase the knowledge exchange on accounting between the Nordic countries
and to serve as a framework for possible collaboration partners to lift further
accounting projects to a Nordic level.
