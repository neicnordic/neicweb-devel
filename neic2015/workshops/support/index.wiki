https://www.nsc.liu.se/~torbenr/neic2015/

National as well as international HPC and e-Science infrastructures are tasked
with providing hardware resources and services to, in many cases, a wide and
varied range of scientific domains and research disciplines within domains. To
ensure that the provided resources are properly accessible to researchers and
well utilised, several types of user support efforts are required.

This workshop will take a broad view on user support efforts and look at
examples of how to organize support, operational services to enable utilisation,
training efforts, project support, proactive efforts, and other efforts that
enable the utilisation of the infrastructure.

* Organisational examples
** Organise per discipline
** First line, second line, etc. style
** Visits, satellite persons
** Use of many-to-many support frameworks (e.g. Stack Overflow style)
* Operational services
** Maintaining development environment
** Maintaining scientific software
** Frameworks for providing documentation and user instructions
* Project support
** Code profiling
** Code porting
** Code optimisation
** ...
* Proactive efforts
** Automatic OOM alerts
** Per job resource utilisation reports
