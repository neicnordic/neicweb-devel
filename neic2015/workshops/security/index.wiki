== Abstract ==
This workshop is not about building things, it's about breaking them.

Do you ever feel like Michael Douglas in Falling Down? Do you ever get the urge
to just rip all the badly written software apart? This workshop is for you.

We will look at classes of vulnerabilities, how to find them, how to exploit
them, and how to trample the system under your feet. Also boring stuff like "pen
test without going to jail" and "report vulnerabilities without getting sued".

There will be hands-on sessions.
