== Abstract ==
The combined sessions will be a game between 3 or more teams. The teams will get
control over storage that they are supposed to build a coherent storage system
usable from another system, using access methods that supports federated
identities.

The jury will stress test the systems the teams build and decide which team has
built the system performing best for a cluster trying to stress it hard.

The jury will run an ARC cluster, and will try to get a data-intensive workload
from the storage teams over 10G ethernet. The teams can select the software they
want to use themselves.
