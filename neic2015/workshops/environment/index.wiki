== Abstract ==
Environmental research studies a wide range of topics from the human impact on
marine ecosystems to understanding the solid part of the earth surface to
biodiversity informatics to atmospheric phenomena to name only a few. The
scientific analysis begins with monitoring physical, chemical, biological and
other environmental values which exhibit large ranges of temporal and spatial
scales across borders of several countries. Understanding the complex
interactions of environmental processes is increasingly requiring to couple
models of different fields and to integrate various data sources. Research
results may have a great impact on the healthy environment of large populations
and their sustainable future.

The need to understand environmental processes on the regional and global scale
has led to increased collaboration on developing research infrastructures (for
example, by the ESFRI roadmap on the European level). Advanced e-Infrastructures
are needed to process and store the data gathered by emerging research
infrastructures. As the research infrastructures are shared by larger and larger
internationally distributed collaborations, e-Infrastructures need to scale with
the increased demands and support more complex analyses. Because findings in
environmental research have implications for so many parts of our global
society, results have to be made available to researchers, governmental agencies
and the general public.

On January 1st, 2015, NeIC has established a new strategic area for
environmental sciences which will facilitate the development and deployment of
e-Infrastructures for enabling and improving collaboration among the Nordic
countries. By presenting the status, plans and challenges for various fields in
environmental research, this workshop aims at exchanging knowledge and fostering
new collaborations on the development of e-Infrastructures.

Workshop topics include but are not restricted to

* tools for collaboration via the internet
* data and metadata: characteristics (time scales, spatial scales), formats,  sources, transfer (amount, remote locations), aggregation, conversion, processing, distributing, real-time access, access licenses, archiving, curation
* computing: analytical tools, batch processing, paradigms (sequential, shared memory, distributed memory, map reduce), workflows
* networks: connection to remote sensing sites
* development and deployment of e-Infrastructures: national, regional, international level; integration into umbrella organizations; funding; technology match; interoperability
* cross-disciplinary challenges
