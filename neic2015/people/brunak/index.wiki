== Bio ==
Søren Brunak, Ph.D., is professor of Bioinformatics at the Technical
University of Denmark and professor of Disease Systems Biology at the
University of Copenhagen. Prof. Brunak is the founding Director of the
Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, which was formed in 1993 as a
multi-disciplinary research group of molecular biologists, biochemists,
medical doctors, physicists, and computer scientists. Søren Brunak has
been highly active within biological data integration, where machine
learning techniques often have been used to integrate predicted or
experimentally established functional genome and proteome annotation.
His current research does combine molecular level systems biology and
healthcare sector data such as electronic patient records and biobank
questionnaires. The aim is to group and stratify patients not only from
their genotype, but also phenotypically based on the clinical
descriptions in the medical records. An additional focus area is now
adverse drug reactions. Søren Brunak is chair of ELIXIR Interim Board.
