== Bio ==
After graduating with a Masters degree in Economics, Richard Welpton
began his career in 2007 in the UK Office for National Statistics
Virtual Microdata Laboratory (VML), supporting academic and government
researchers with business microdata, before moving to the UK Data
Archive in 2010 to assist in establishing the Secure Data Service.  That
service has now been fully integrated into the UK Data Service, and
Richard now oversees the operations of the Secure Lab as a member of the
Archiveâ€™s Information Security Management Group.  In addition, Richard
has overall responsibility for statistical disclosure control of
research outputs that are released from the Secure Lab environment, and
ensuring that researchers are satisfactorily trained in this area.
Richard has contributed to this subject, speaking at conferences such as
the UNECE/Eurostat statistical confidentiality workshop, and contributed
to ESSnet and DwB guidelines.  Richard also attends the UK Anonymisation
Network and represents the Archive on statistical confidentiality
matters.
