== Bio ==
Holger Dettki studied Biology and Chemistry at the Einstein University
Ulm, Germany, before he moved to Sweden. He earned his doctoral degree
in 2000 at Umeå University, working on landscape ecology models for
lichen dispersal and establishment. Working as a GPS and GIS expert, he
became involved in 2003 in GPS-tracking projects of moose in Northern
Sweden at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) and
developed software tools to automate data handling and visualization.
Between 2011 and 2014 he was tasked by the Swedish Research Council with
the upgrade of these tools into the Wireless Remote Animal Monitoring
(WRAM) e-infrastructure as the national database node for biotelemetry
sensor data from animals. He is currently heading the Umeå Center for
Wireless Remote Animal Monitoring (UC-WRAM) at SLU and engaged in
national and international cooperations on biotelemetry data management
and sharing. Beside this engagement he works as an Associate Professor
in several projects analyzing animal movement and behavior of e.g.,
brown bear, moose, or golden eagle.
