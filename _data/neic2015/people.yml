# === How to edit this file ===
# This file is in the YAML format [http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Preview].
#
# Each person is one block of text, starting with an ID label, and then indented
# "key: value" pairs, on separate lines.
#
# ID goes on the first line followed by colon. No whitespace before it.
# The rest of the lines are indented and hold key:value information about the person. 
# Values can contain html. If you need to type a lot of text, start with > and start 
# typing on the next line, with more indentation (e.g. one more tab or space character). 
#
# If in doubt, see the YAML documentation. It's an easy read.
