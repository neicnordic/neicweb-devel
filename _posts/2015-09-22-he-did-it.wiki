''Predictions are uncertain, but our scenarios indicate that we could see swarms of flying pigs and a rapid and dramatic decrease of temperatures in hell'' one spokesperson for the UN climate panel admitted. Amidst fear and speculation, the UN climate panel today warns of irreversible damage to our climate.
