'''Researchers seeking to share biomedical data between Nordic countries face both technical and legal hurdles. The joint Nordic project Tryggve offers services that address these challenges by allowing researchers to process and share data securely across national borders – without transferring sensitive data via poorly protected means such as USB drives or personal laptop computers.'''

“The challenge we are working on is how to make the vast amount of data on health and well-being available to researchers in a good way,” explains Antti Pursula of the CSC – IT Center for Science in Finland and project leader of the Tryggve project. “Health and registry data are very valuable for research, and great advances are being made in genetics and medical research thanks to this kind of data. At the same time, in legal terms this type of data falls into a category of sensitive personal data requiring that proper security measures are taken to protect the privacy of the participating individuals, such as making sure that all use of these data is authorised.”

Health data used for research purposes are typically anonymised by removing personal details such as names and personal identity numbers and using registry numbers instead. Nevertheless, the data involved may be so detailed that they still can reveal which individual is hidden behind a specific registry number.

“In a typical use case, there is a hospital study collecting data from volunteer subjects,” continues Mr Pursula. “There are DNA sequences, some basic information on the volunteers such as lifestyle, diet or exercise habits, as well as whether or not they have been diagnosed with a specific condition. This is so much information that in some cases it may actually be possible to deduce the identity of specific persons. This shows why it is important to protect these data properly when used in research.”

==Project development with user involvements==

Dr Flix estimates in the evaluation that the annual operational costs could be cut from roughly Euro 3 million to Euro 2.3 million by consolidating the six centres into a single location.

“The report was very thorough,” says a pleased Pekka Lehtovuori, chair of the NeIC board. “It clearly showed that the distributed Tier 1 centre is not as cost-effective as the centralised centres can be. However, the report also points out some of the benefits which are not easy to measure in euros, for example collaboration and readiness to develop services in a distributed environment. These are competencies which are increasingly important in future global or European research infrastructure services.”

The evaluation shows that the estimated savings of consolidating the Nordic Tier 1 centre roughly correspond to the in-kind contributions from the six participating institutions. The actual savings to the national funding agencies would thus likely be less.

In the current model, the Nordic Tier 1 centre benefits from being part of a larger-scale high-performance computing centre at Nordic research institutions. At the same time, says Dr Flix, there are political challenges associated with transferring national funding for operation across national borders in order to fund a joint, physically co-localised centre.

==Nordic expertise is valuable==

Not least, the Nordic centre's unique expertise – acquired from running a distributed centre – is very valuable for future methods of analysing large amounts of data. This could be significant when the CERN cooperation upgrades the particle accelerator to the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider.

“Already now we can foresee that with the high-luminosity era, we’ll have a factor 100 increase in data. Even though we know that we can benefit from our developing technology, this won’t be enough,” says Josep Flix. “Therefore, we need to join forces across borders in order to confederate our data and resources. And we can learn from the Nordic way of doing it.”

==A number of possible scenarios==

The evaluation report compares a number of possible scenarios for how the Nordic Tier 1 centre may be operated in the future. Cutting the total from six centres to four, i.e. keeping one centre in each participating country, could save roughly Euro 400 000 per year. An alternative scenario is to consolidate the Nordic centre into one country but continue to have all the participating countries fund and manage their own share of the hardware involved. This kind of model could save an estimated Euro 300 000 per year. Finally, marginal savings of Euro 125 000 per year could be achieved by having the NeIC assume operational management but maintain the system of distributed resources.

“The board will consider the analysis carefully in order to find out how we can introduce some savings to the operational costs of the Tier 1 and still maintain most of the benefits of current collaboration,” says Pekka Lehtovuori.
