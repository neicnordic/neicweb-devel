Environmental research studies a wide range of topics from the human impact on marine ecosystems to understanding the solid part of the earth surface to biodiversity informatics to atmospheric phenomena to name only a few. The scientific analysis  begins with monitoring physical, chemical, biological and other environmental values which exhibit large ranges of temporal and spatial scales across borders of several countries. Understanding the complex interactions of environmental processes is increasingly requiring to couple models of different fields and to integrate various data sources. Research results may have a great impact on the healthy environment of large populations and their sustainable future.

Advanced e-Infrastructures are needed to process and store the data gathered by emerging environmental research infrastructures. As the research infrastructures are shared by larger and larger internationally distributed collaborations, e-Infrastructures need to scale with the increased demands and support more complex analyses. NeIC, as an organization hosted by NordForsk and receiving co-funding from the Nordic national e-Infrastructure providers, is in an excellent position to bring together experts from various fields of science, computer science, and providers to develop and operate the needed e-Infrastructures.
