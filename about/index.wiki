= About NeIC =

'''The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) is an organisation that facilitates the development and operation of high-quality e-Infrastructure solutions in areas of joint Nordic interest. The NeIC is a distributed organisation consisting of technical experts from academic high-performance computing centres across the Nordic countries.'''

The collaboration was launched in 2003 in response to a decision by the research funding agencies in the Nordic countries to contribute to a distributed computing infrastructure for analysing and storing the data generated by experiments at the [http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/large-hadron-collider Large Hadron Collider (LHC)] at [http://home.web.cern.ch/ CERN] (the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers).

New, innovative services can be developed and deployed by bringing together the 
competencies of all the Nordic e-Infrastructure providers, and challenging this 
pool of highly skilled IT experts with the needs of the Nordic user communities. 
This is precisely what the NeIC aims to do in key areas of common Nordic interest. By combining the expertise already found in the Nordic region, we can provide leverage for more efficient and responsive e-Infrastructure, thereby avoiding 
costly duplication of work in each individual country. An important focus of the 
NeIC in the coming years will be on innovation in new e-Infrastructure solutions, in addition to selected services such as the Nordic Tier-1 service for the WLCG community.

The NeIC was established as an organisational unit under <a href="http://www.nordforsk.org/en">NordForsk</a> in Oslo on 1 January 2012.
